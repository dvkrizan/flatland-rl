# Reinforcement Learning Applied to Transportation
###### Capstone students: Claire-Isabelle Carlier and David Krizan

## Overview and Deliverables
Our Capstone Project goal was to learn about Reinforcement Learning and apply it to a real-world problem. 
We opted to work with the Flatland environment. Flatland is an open-source toolkit for developing and comparing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithms applied to the [vehicle rescheduling problem (VRSP)](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.86.5205&rep=rep1&type=pdf). VRSP seeks to address the situation where a vehicle breaks down or is delayed during operation in a public transportation system, where other vehicles need to be rescheduled to minimize the impact of the issue on the network.
The Flatland environment has been developed by the Swiss Federal Railway (SBB) and Deutsche Bahnn, in collaboration with AICrowd, a platform for AI Competition (see credits at the bottom). Several competitions were lead using this environment, including the recent NeurIPS 2020 Challenge. 

As a lot of code had already been developed (as we learned throughout this project), we focused on understanding the concepts, debugging the environment, creating visualizations of our results and playing with hyperparameters to improve existing code. 
Our deliverables include:
- This git repository to run the code (please see below for instructions on how to run the code and generate GIF clips
- A [video introduction to core concepts of Reinforcement Learning applied to the Flatland environment](link) that we strongly encourage you to watch before reading the blog and playing with the code.
- A [blog post on Proximal Policy Optimization](link), an on-policy technique to solve the Flatland challenge, that includes a code walk-through.


## How to run the code
To be able to run the code, you should follow the following steps (we assume you use conda to host your environments):
1. Create an environment to host your Flatland experiments. Note that you will need to use python 3.6 for compatibility reasons:
`conda create python=3.6 --name flatland-rl`
2. Once your environment has been created, you need to activate it:
`conda activate flatland-rl`
3. Now that your environment has been created, install the flatland-rl python package via conda:
`pip install flatland-rl`
4. You will need additional packages to be able to run the code. Here are the libraries you should be installing:
`pip install pandas numpy psutils shutil argparse`
5. If you have a NVIDIA GPU on your computer, install a [recent version of the CUDA toolkit (9 or above)](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) on your computer, then run the following command to tie it to pytorch (do not install pytorch prior to this):
`conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=<your version of cuda> -c pytorch`
Otherwise, you will need to pip install pytorch. 
6. To generate nice videos and GIFs of your runs, you will need FFMPEG:
`conda install ffmpeg` (do not pip install if you are on Windows!)


ðŸš‚ The code is this repository is based on the official starter kit - NeurIPS 2020 Flatland Challenge and has been modified for the purpose of our Capstone project.
